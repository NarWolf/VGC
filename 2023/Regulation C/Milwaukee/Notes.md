# Soft Trick Room Hyper Offense @ Milwaukee

This team had heavy influence from Alex Gómez Berna's EUIC team and was created with help from Justin Tang. I took this team to compete at my first ever event and finished 101st with a record of 6-3 and received 40 Championship Points. I was able to pilot this team to Ultra Ball on Ladder.

## Twitter (Flutter Mane)

Flutter Mane is very strong and worth building a team around, as seen by its high usage rate in Regulation B and C.

It has its most basic STAB moves with Moonblast and Shadow Ball. While it doesn't have Dazzling Gleam, it does have Trick Room which allows the rest of the team to take over in certain situations. Protect is always a solid move.

It's investment in bulk allows it to survive strong neutral physical attacks, such as Palafin Jet Punches and Chien-Pao Sucker Punches. It also allows it to survive Flutter Mane Shadow Balls with Tera Fairy when Beads of Ruin is active.

## Hans (Chi-Yu)

Chi-Yu is a good partner for Flutter Mane due to its Beads of Ruin ability, as well as  member of the Fire-Water-Grass core that this team features.

Heat Wave, Dark Pulse, and Overheat are all strong options for Chi-Yu, with Heat Wave allow it to constantly be whittling down the opposing Pokémon. Tera Grass is a good Tera Type for Chi-Yu as it flips the Grass and Ground matchups, which is specifically useful for Palafin, Gyarados, and Ting-Lu, and removes it's fighting weakness. It also is useful to give a Grass STAB move in Tera Blast.

Chi-Yu with Choice Scarf is fast enough to outspeed Pokémon as fast as Dragapult with full speed investment and no Choice Scarf. It has enough investment in bulk to survive Jet Punch and Earthquake from Pokémon with -1 in Attack.

## Iroh (Gyarados)

Gyarados is a member of the Fire-Water-Grass core, as well as providing intimidate for Physical Pokémon, like Palafin, Chien-Pao, Dragonite, Ting-Lu, and Great Tusk. It is also a counter to Amoonguss.

Waterfall is its strongest STAB move and it can KO Ting-Lu with at most 3 of them. Taunt stops Amoonguss or Trick Room setters from having any presence. Thunder Wave provides speed control. Protect is always a solid move.

Tera Fairy is not the best choice for most Gyarados, but since this team is Ground-weak, Fairy suffices, since it makes all of Gyarados's weaknesses into neutral matchups.

## Sock (Amoonguss)

Amoonguss is the last member of the Fire-Water-Grass core. It is particularly useful against Trick Room teams.

Spore slows down opposing threats, especially under Trick Room. Rage Powder provides support for ally Pokémon, allowing them to have turns without being targeted. Pollen Puff is one of Amoonguss's best offensive moves, but it also allows it to heal Pokémon, which fills its niche as a support Pokémon well. Clear Smog is specifically for matchups against the Dondozo Tatsugiri combination, but is also useful from stopping other Pokémon that like to use setup moves.

Tera Water is a good defensive choice as it flips the matchup with Fire and Ice.

## Magnus (Kingambit)

Kingambit is a strong Pokémon that tends to do well regardless of the opposing Pokémon with its Defiant ability. It has a lot of bulk, especially with Assault Vest.

Sucker Punch is a very strong priority move that comes with STAB. Since Kingambit is relatively slow, Assurance is a good choice, since it will often do double damage. Iron Head is its strongest Steel STAB move. Low Kick is good coverage for Dark types like Ting-Lu. 

The Tera Flying is useful for facing down Ground Types.

Its speed allows it to outspeed a fully speed invested Dragonite that is paralized. It is bulky enough to survive a Drain Punch from Iron Hands with -1 in Attack.

## Fanatic (Iron Hands)

Iron Hands is a similar case to Kingambit. It is very bulky and is able to set up to take over a game, aided by Tera Fire, which stops it from being burned and having its Attack cut in half. Iron Hands is very prone to being stopped by Powder moves, so Safety Goggles negates this weakness.

Drain Punch allows Iron Hands to stick around for a while, as well as healing up from its strong Wild Charges. Drain Punch is also enough to KO most Chi-Yu in one hit. Swords Dance allows it to take over games if its able to get one off. Protect is always a solid move.

Its investmenent in bulk allows it to survive Headlong Rushes from Adamant Great Tusks. Its speed allows it to outspeed a fully speed invested Dragonite that is paralized.
